I did not count the time building the chassis kit.

### Thursday, October 16th | 30 minutes
Spent 30 minutes designing a simple riser so that I can fit more stuff on the tank. There is not enough room otherwise. This is mainly so I can start installing everything tmrw, once I have an idea of where things fit, I'll make a better version.

Tested V1 of the riser. It covered the tracks fine, but I made the screw holes too small and mismeasured where the holes in the chassis are. I spent 30 making V2 with the following improvements.
- Fix size of screw holes
- Fix chassis mountiung hole locations
- Add holes for mounting RPI Zero
- Add holes to ziptie batterys on the edge

Took apart the car and tracks to test V2 of the riser. The mounting holes distance to edge rn is good but apparently I misread the design sheet and made them to far apart. So I made a quick edit and started V3 on the printer.

Soldered a bunch of cables to the motor controllers and did first boot of pi from the tank battery. V3 of the riser is almost done printing. Going to start researching and writing code to make the motors spin!

Got the car to drive. But one of the free wheels is locking up, v3 of the riser but finished printing so I'll fix the wheel as I put the new version on. Put V3 of riser on tank. ALL SCREWS LINE UP!!

Added a lcd screen that displays the IP because it kept changing ip. Also wrote code so that it auto displays on boot. Right now its seprate from main.py but at some point I will find a way to intigrate once I feel safe having it auto run main.py.
